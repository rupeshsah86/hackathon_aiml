🎯 AI-Powered Internship Recommender

A Machine Learning-based Web Application that provides personalized internship recommendations to students based on their skills, interests, and preferences.

📋 Project Overview

This project leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques to match students with the most relevant internship opportunities.
It uses TF-IDF Vectorization and Cosine Similarity to compute how closely student profiles match with internship descriptions.
